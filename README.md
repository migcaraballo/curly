# curly
Simple/Easy Terminal App that leverages native curl command. Offers easy input, and saves results to a history list cache.

### Download
you can always clone this repo and build the app yourself, however, if you want to just run the app, check the **'dist'** directory for a pre-built binary.

### Running
Open Terminal or equivalent on Mac, or Command Prompt in Windows (linux users already know).

Change directory to where you put the binary after download...
``` 
shell> ./curly 
```

more coming soon...
